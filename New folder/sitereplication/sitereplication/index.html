        <div class="grid-3-columns">
           <div class="ben">
            <h3>Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
            <p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet. whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But specific honey varietals knows as "active" honeys have also been utilised throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="ben">
            <h3>Natural Cough Medicine</h3>
            <p>Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study, it can also relieve cough more effectively than OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan(DM), a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="ben">
            <h3>Lowers Blood Pressure</h3>
            <p>Blood pressure is a important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure. Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="ben">
            <h3>Improve Cholesterol</h3>
            <p>Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL(bad)cholesterolby 6-11% and lowers triglyceride levels by much as 11%. Honey may also increase HDL(good) cholesterol by about 3%.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="ben">
            <h3>Improves Heart Health</h3>
            <p>it's high antioxidants, such as phenolicacids and flavonoids, which may support better health. Small studies in human show honey's antioxidants could help improve cholesterol levels, which could help decrease the risk for heart disease, although larger long-term studies are needed to confirm those finding.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="ben">
            <h3>Antibacterial properties</h3>
            <p>Honey contains hydrogen peroxide, which may account for some of its antibacterial properties. it also has a high sugar content, which can help stop the growth of certaon bacteria. Additionally, honey has low pH level. This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.</p>
